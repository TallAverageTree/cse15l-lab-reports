# Lab 4: Vim (Week 7)

## Step 1
I make sure that my directory is `lab7` and if it isn't, I make sure that I use the command `cd lab7` in order to change my directory. I then put into my terminal the command `vim ListExamples.java` in order
to access the doucment and start edting the document.

![vim ListExamples](https://github.com/TallAverageTree/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/146666323/eb58e0bf-455a-4f26-a037-d9a3e95877fb)

## Step 2
Keys Pressed: `<down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>,
<down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <down>, <right>, <right>, <right>, <right>, <right>, <right>, 
<right>, <right>, <right>, <right>, <right>, <right>, <x>, <i>, <2>, <esc>, <:>, <w>, <q>, <enter>`

Meaning: The line which I had to change was on line 43, so I pressed down until I reached line 43, then I moved right 11 times to get to the 1 in `index1 += 1;`
